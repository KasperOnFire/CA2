            <h3>How to use?</h3>
            <p>The system is a simple chat system using a client-server structure. Each client connects to a server using IP
                and port number for the server and then logs in with a username.</p>
            <p> Whenever a user logs in or out the server posts a list of all current users to every active user. You send a
                message to one or more users by typing MSG:&ltuser1,user2,…&gt:&ltmessage&gt.</p>
            <p>You can message all users by typing MSG:*: &ltmessage&gt. It is very important to respect this format and to
                not use colons as they are a reserved character. Using this format will allow you to connect to multiple
                servers(not just this one!), as it is used as a standard format.

            <h3>Design</h3>
            <p>We based the system on an initial bare-bones “chat system” that echoed every message to every user without usernames.
                We have designed the client using an observer pattern, and allowing it to work both with and without a simple
                GUI .</p>

            <h3>Testing of client</h3>
            <p>Testing our client against another groups server went well. There were no issues with the test.</p>
